```{r}
# The `params` object is available in the document.
params$n
```

A plot of `params$n` random points.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(rnorm(params$n), rnorm(params$n))
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
